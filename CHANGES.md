   for dependencies.

## Version 20.12.0 (2020-12-13)

 * Return correct MACHINE\_ARCH when using $arch in repositories.conf.

## Version 20.11.0 (2020-11-02)

   is.

## Version 0.16.1 (2020-04-29)

 * Don't attempt to update the keep list if we're only downloading packages.

   from output.

   that a failed update can be repaired easily.
 * Switch NetBSD default repository from ftp.netbsd.org to cdn.netbsd.org.

   attempting to pull in the highest version.  Resolves issues with installing
   packages depending on samba and their conflicts against tdb and talloc.

 * Allow -y flag to work with autoremove.

   refresh, upgrade, and install, with package lists formatted to be
   easier to read.

   has changed, to ensure rebuilt dependencies are correctly handled.
 * Download handling fixes.
